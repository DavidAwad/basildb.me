# Simple Flask Guest Book

A guest book is a simple app that allows a user to leave their name and a message, and see the other names and messages of users who have _signed_ before them.

This app is ment to be an example in building a simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) app with GETs, POSTs, and inserting and reading from an SQL database using [dataset](https://dataset.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
