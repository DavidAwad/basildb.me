# Simple Flask Guest Book

A guest book is a simple app that allows a user to leave their name and a message, and see the other names and messages of users who have _signed_ before them.

This app is ment to be an example in building a simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) app with GETs, POSTs, and inserting and reading from an SQL database using [dataset](https://dataset.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

# Basildb.me 

This is a flask web app that takes all of the nicknames we can come up with for my friend Basil Ahmad. 

It currently works and I'll be hosting it on digitalocean in the near future. 

Please enjoy the wonderful UX/UI. (I'm in love with it!)
