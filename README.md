# Basildb.me 

This is a flask web app that takes all of the nicknames we can come up with for my friend Basil Ahmad. 

It currently works and I'll be hosting it on digitalocean in the near future. 

Please enjoy the wonderful UX/UI. (I'm in love with it!)

If you want to make pull requests please send me an email first describing your changes first and preferably a link to a runnable.com host of it. Thanks!
