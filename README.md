# Basildb.me 

This is a flask web app that takes all of the nicknames we can come up with for my friend Basil Ahmad. 

It currently works and I'll be hosting it on digitalocean in the near future. 

Please enjoy the wonderful UX/UI. (I'm in love with it!)

## Run the server

1. In your terminal, navigat to the repo's directory and run app.py
```
cd [REPO LOCATION]
python app.py
```

2. Access app from localhost:5000
